# Auth

ClickClack accepts four ways to identify a caller, in order of precedence. The
resolver lives in `apps/api/internal/httpapi/server.go` (`currentActor`).

1. `Authorization: Bearer <token>` — bearer session token or `ccb_...` bot
   token. Bot tokens resolve to the bot user plus token workspace/scopes.
2. Session cookie — `cc_session` by default, or the configured namespaced
   cookie. It is HTTP-only and set by magic-link consume and GitHub OAuth.
3. `X-ClickClack-User: usr_...` header — explicit user impersonation for local
   development and tests, accepted only from loopback clients using local
   request hosts.
4. Dev fallback — the very first user in the database. Enabled only by
   `clickclack serve --dev-bootstrap=true` so a fresh checkout can boot into a
   working app without any token plumbing, and accepted only from local
   requests.

The dev fallback must stay off in any non-local deployment. `--dev-bootstrap=false`
is the default; require real sessions.

## Local owner bootstrap

`clickclack serve --dev-bootstrap=true` calls `Store.EnsureBootstrap`.
That helper:

- Returns the first user if one exists.
- Otherwise creates a `Local Captain` user, a `ClickClack` workspace, and a
  `general` channel, then returns the new user.

To pin the owner identity instead, run the CLI before serving:

```sh
clickclack admin bootstrap --name "Peter" --email steipete@gmail.com
```

That prints the new `usr_...` ID. Pass it back via `X-ClickClack-User` or use
the magic-link flow to mint a session.

## Magic links

Magic-link tokens are short-lived bearer credentials. In local dev mode the
HTTP request endpoint returns the token for convenience. With dev auth disabled,
the request endpoint is disabled until SMTP delivery exists; create tokens with
the admin CLI instead. The consume endpoint exchanges a token for a durable
session. In local dev mode, the HTTP request endpoint returns the token only
for loopback clients using local request hosts.

```http
POST /api/auth/magic/request
{ "email": "steipete@gmail.com", "display_name": "Peter" }

POST /api/auth/magic/consume
{ "token": "<token>" }
```

Magic-link consume requests must use `Content-Type: application/json`. Browser
requests with cross-site `Origin` or `Sec-Fetch-Site` headers are rejected so a
foreign site cannot force a browser session onto another account.

For production-style deployments, use the CLI delivery path until SMTP delivery
exists:

```sh
clickclack admin magic-link create --email steipete@gmail.com --name "Peter"
```

The client CLI can consume that token directly:

```sh
clickclack login --magic-token mgt_...
```

For remote human-operated clients, use the resulting bearer session token. For
hosted bots, prefer a scoped `ccb_...` bot token from `admin bot create`. The
CLI will not send a stored bearer token to a different `--server`, and it skips
stored bearer tokens when `--user` / `CLICKCLACK_USER_ID` is set without an
explicit `--token`.

`ConsumeMagicLink` returns `{user, session, token}` and sets the configured
HTTP-only session cookie. Browsers can drop the body; non-browser clients
should hold the `session.token` for the `Authorization` header. Session cookies
default to `Secure` outside local dev HTTP, even if a reverse proxy omits HTTPS
headers. Duplicate cookies with the active session-cookie name are rejected
instead of relying on cookie ordering.

## GitHub OAuth (optional)

GitHub OAuth is opt-in. Set the public URL, client ID, and client secret (or
the equivalent config keys) before serving:

```sh
CLICKCLACK_PUBLIC_URL=https://chat.example.com
# Optional only when trusted instances share one hostname:
# CLICKCLACK_COOKIE_NAMESPACE=production
CLICKCLACK_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=...
CLICKCLACK_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=...
# Optional org gate:
# CLICKCLACK_GITHUB_ALLOWED_ORG=openclaw
# Optional moderator org for open guest login:
# CLICKCLACK_GITHUB_MODERATOR_ORG=openclaw
```

Without a client ID and client secret, `GET /api/auth/github/start` returns `501`.

Flow:

1. `GET /api/auth/github/start` creates a database-backed, ten-minute OAuth
   transaction, sets an HTTP-only browser-binding cookie, and redirects to
   GitHub with a SHA-256 PKCE challenge.
2. GitHub redirects back to `GET /api/auth/github/callback?code&state`.
3. The handler atomically consumes the state only when the browser binding
   matches, exchanges the code with the stored PKCE verifier and exact redirect
   URI, fetches `/user` and primary `/user/emails`, checks configured org
   membership, and upserts the GitHub identity.
4. The handler joins the appropriate workspace, creates a session, sets the
   configured session cookie, and redirects to `/`.

The server stores hashes of state and browser-binding values. The short-lived
PKCE verifier is stored because the callback must send it to GitHub. State is
single-use, survives process restarts and multiple replicas, and permits up to
eight concurrent starts for one browser. Expired rows are removed during new
starts. Global pending-row limits bound abandoned or hostile starts.

The desktop app uses the same GitHub callback through a system-browser handoff:

1. The app creates a high-entropy verifier and opens
   `GET /api/auth/github/desktop/start?code_challenge=<SHA-256 challenge>&desktop_protocol=2`
   in the default browser.
2. After the normal GitHub callback succeeds, the server redirects to
   `chat.clickclack.desktop:/auth/callback?code=<opaque one-time grant>`. No
   GitHub or ClickClack session token is placed in the URL.
3. The app posts the grant and its verifier to
   `POST /api/auth/github/desktop/consume`. The exact initiating server
   atomically invalidates the grant, creates a session, and sets the configured
   cookie in Electron's persistent session.
4. The app calls `/api/me` through that same Electron session and loads `/app`
   only after the server confirms the authenticated user. The desktop client
   never depends on a particular cookie name.

Desktop transactions expire after ten minutes; completed grants expire after
five. Grants are persisted so the callback and redemption can hit different
replicas or a restarted process. The verifier binding prevents another local
application from redeeming a custom-protocol callback it intercepts. Grant
codes are stored only as hashes and are single-use. Protocol-1 callbacks carry
a 32-character lowercase hexadecimal grant; protocol-2 callbacks carry a
43-character unpadded base64url grant. The consume endpoint accepts exactly
those two formats during the compatibility window.

Protocol-1 desktop clients remain compatible with deployments using the default
cookie names and receive the legacy `clickclack://auth/callback` handoff.
Namespaced deployments return HTTP 426 before redirecting an old client to
GitHub, because that client cannot verify a namespaced session. Protocol-2
clients accept both callback formats so they can sign in to old and new
servers.

The redirect URL is always derived from `CLICKCLACK_PUBLIC_URL` in production.
Request-host derivation exists only for explicit loopback development. Configure
GitHub with `<public-url>/api/auth/github/callback`.

OAuth starts are public endpoints. The database enforces global and per-browser
pending-row bounds. A deployment may also rate-limit
`/api/auth/github/start`, `/api/auth/github/desktop/start`, and
`/api/auth/github/desktop/consume` at an edge that has a trustworthy client
identity. Do not derive security limits from untrusted forwarded IP headers or
add a naive application-level IP limiter. See the deployment documentation for
[hosted edge ownership](../deployment.md#hosted-deployment) and the
[optional self-hosted Nginx example](../deployment.md#optional-self-hosted-nginx-example),
capacity limits, monitoring, and sensitive logging requirements.

When metrics are enabled, `clickclack_github_oauth_events_total` exposes only a
fixed event category, including starts, state rejection, provider failure,
capacity rejection, desktop protocol mismatch, and successful handoff. It never
labels state, grants, users, cookies, callback parameters, or tokens.

Without `CLICKCLACK_GITHUB_ALLOWED_ORG`, any GitHub account can sign in and is
automatically joined to an isolated `Guests` workspace. When
`CLICKCLACK_GITHUB_MODERATOR_ORG` is set, non-members of that org start as
waiting-room guests with a three-post daily budget until a moderator promotes
them to `member`; matching GitHub org members become moderators in the guest
workspace. If the moderator org is unset, open-login users join as normal
members so the workspace cannot become ownerless.

Open guest deployments with a moderator org, and org-gated deployments, request
`read:org`. GitHub only returns private org membership after the user grants
that scope, so team-only hosting should set `CLICKCLACK_GITHUB_ALLOWED_ORG`.

Guest restrictions and moderator controls are documented in
[moderation.md](moderation.md).

## Authorization

Every store mutation that touches a workspace runs `requireMembership` (or the
in-tx variant). API handlers do not duplicate that check — trust the store
layer for it. WebSocket subscriptions revalidate `GetWorkspace` before
upgrading.

Workspace roles are `owner`, `moderator`, `member`, `guest`, and `bot`. The
store enforces guest room visibility, guest post budgets, timeout/block state,
and moderator rank before writes. HTTP handlers still call store methods
rather than duplicating those checks.

Bot tokens add a second layer on top of membership: scope checks and a token
workspace check. See [bots.md](bots.md).

## Sessions

`sessions` are bearer tokens with an `expires_at`. `GetSessionUser` resolves the
token to a `User`. There is no refresh flow — issue a new session when one
expires.

## What is intentionally missing

- Email/password login.
- Password reset.
- SMTP delivery for magic links (V0 prints the token; V1 will add delivery).
- Per-channel ACLs and a historical moderation audit log.
